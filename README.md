## Image Classification Using ConvNets

This project is about implementing and training a Convolutional Neural Network to learn to distinguish between 10 different articles that are part of the [CIFAR10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html). The CIFAR-10 dataset contains 50 000 training images and 10 000 test images. Each image is of size 32Ã—32 with three channels for red, green, and blue. Each image belongs to one of ten classes: plane, car, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, or truck

## Motivation
This project was a part of Assignment 2 of the "Deep Learning Lab" course at USI, Lugano taken by [Dr. Kazuki Irie](https://people.idsia.ch/~kazuki/).

## Tech used
<b>Built with</b>
- [Python3](https://www.python.org)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org)
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org)


## Features
The project includes implementation and exploration of the following ideas related to CNNs and Deep Learning projects in general:
- Normalizing the dataset within all 3 channels (red, green abd blue) using mean and standard deviation.
- Seeing the effect of regularization via dropout layers placed after Convolutional layers and Feed forward layer
- Hyperparameter tuning with the learning rates and dropout probabilities.

A report can be found explaining my findings in this repo titled `Report.pdf`
